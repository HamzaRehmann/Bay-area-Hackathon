# Bay-area-Hackathon

Our program works as a productive timer, allowing the user to select up to 60 minutes and providing an option to reset the timer as well as check the log list of previous users or the user themselves to keep track of their usage. The files named updated timer.css, updated timer.html, and updated.js, as well as the audio mp3 file, contain the code and audio for our small program. We've also included our previous plan files in this repository to show that we tried to turn our previous plan into a reality.

In order to run the program kindly use updated timer.css, updated timer.html, and updated.js files on any compiler and then you will be able to use this program.

Thank you for reading.
